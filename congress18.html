        <h3>General Advice</h3>
        <p class="intro">We hope that you have a pleasant and safe trip to Perú and wish to request that you please take a
                  few minutes to read the following useful information. </p>
        <p class="intro">Before travelling, make sure if you need a visa to come to Peru and that you are carrying a valid passport.</p>
        <h4>Arriving at Peru Airport</h4>
        <p class="intro">DO NOT ride a taxi outside the airport. There are several taxi companies which you can hire before
          leaving Immigration. The more affordable is Taxi Green.</p>
        <h4>Hotels</h4>
          <ol class="advice">
            <li>The Congress has special rates on 3 hotels but you need to book them through our web page when you register. 
              We will have return transportation from these hotels to the Congress site (PUCP’s campus) and we will provide
              timetables and schedules.</li>
            <li>When arriving at the hotel, hand your passport to the receptionist. They need to photocopy it so that you
              can get the international visitor’s tax exemption.</li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p class="intro">During the month of July, it is winter in Peru and temperatures reach between 57°F to
                  66°F (14ºC - 19ºC.). You might need to bring warm clothes because it is very humid.</p>
        <h4>Health</h4>
        <p class="intro">Please drink only bottled water as tap water is not recommended. Peruvian food, although
                        very tasty, can be spicy and seasoned.</p>
        <h4>Time</h4>
        <p class="intro">Lima time coincides with Eastern Standard in the US and is 5 hours behind GMT.</p>
        <h4>electric Current</h4>
        <p class="intro>220V although most hotels have special 110V convertors.</p>
